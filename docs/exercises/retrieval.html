<h2>Exercises &#187; Boolean Retrieval</h2>

<div class="post">
<div class="content">

<p>Write a Boolean retrieval engine that uses the index created in the
<a href="indexing.html">inverted indexing</a> exercise.  Your
retrieval engine should be able to handle complex Boolean queries of
the following form:</p>

<pre>
( slings AND arrows ) OR ( mortal AND coil )
( et AND tu AND brute )
</pre>

<p>As a note, the inverted index you constructed in the previous
exercise is specifically designed for ranked retrieval.  For Boolean
retrieval, the
<i>df</i> and <i>tf</i> of terms are not used.</p>

<p>Your system will need to parse nested Boolean queries.  To make
query processing simpler, you can choose the notation in which the
queries are expressed: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix notation</a>
(as above) or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">prefix
notation</a>, e.g., "(AND slings arrows)".  In fact, you can even
write a query parser that uses <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">reverse
polish notation</a>&mdash;it has many advantages, one of which is that
all expressions can be unambiguously interpreted without parentheses.
As a hint, reverse polish notation actually yields the simplest
implementation.</p>

<p>As with previous exercises, use the sample input included in
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>, <a
href="../../data/bible+shakes.nopunc.gz">the Bible and the complete
works of Shakespeare</a>.  As a bare minimum, your Boolean retrieval
engine must be able to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Process arbitrarily complex, nested queries, implementing both
  the "AND" and "OR" operators.</li>

  <li>Return the docno and full text of the lines from the sample
  collection that matches the query.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, in response to the query "outrageous AND fortune",
your retrieval engine should return something like:</p>

<pre>
4442172  the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
</pre>

<p>To give another example, in response to the query "white AND rose",
your retrieval engine should return something like:</p>

<pre>
7841087  from off this brier pluck a white rose with me
7841354  i pluck this white rose with plantagenet
7841879  giving my verdict on the white rose side
7841972  lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
7842315  in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
7842458  shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
7845524  shall send between the red rose and the white
8237199  until the white rose that i wear be dyed
8275306  the red rose and the white are on his face
9067070  we will unite the white rose and the red
</pre>

<p>Once you have the Boolean search engine working, try out these
sample queries:</p>

<pre>
means AND deceit
(white OR red ) AND rose AND pluck
(unhappy OR outrageous OR (good AND your)) AND fortune
</pre>

</div></div>

<h2>Practical Tips</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>This exercise is meant to be completed outside of Hadoop.  Build
your inverted index in Hadoop, as per the <a
href="indexing.html">inverted indexing</a> exercise.  If you
set the number of reducers to one, all the postings will be written to
a single file.  This will make the index easier to manipulate.
Obviously, this isn't a scalable solution, but it will suffice for
this exercise.  Retrieve your index from HDFS with the <code>hadoop fs
-get</code> command.  Implement your Boolean retrieval engine to
manipulate the inverted index stored on your local machine.</p>

<div class="post">
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>Some optional features you might want to consider implementing
are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Support for the Boolean "NOT" operator.  Or try the "AND-NOT"
  operator, which is a bit easier.  The query "(a AND-NOT b)"
  retrieves documents that contain a, but not b.</li>

  <li>Ordering of retrieved documents based on the number of matching
  terms (or something similarly sensical).  For example, given the
  query "(a AND b)", lines that have four occurrences of the query
  terms should be place ahead of lines that have three occurrences of
  the query terms.</li>

</ul>
