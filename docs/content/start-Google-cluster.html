<h2>Getting started with the Google/IBM CLuE cluster</h2>

<div class="post">
<div class="content">

<p>These instructions are intended help you get onto the Google/IBM
Hadoop cluster, available via the <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf08560/nsf08560.htm">NSF CLuE
program</a> and the <a
href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/let-thousand-servers-bloom.html">Google/IBM
Academic Cloud Computing Initiative (ACCI)</a> to University of
Maryland students who are working in the context of those two
projects.</p>

<p>In these instructions, I will refer to the following machines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GATEWAY: the gateway machine (IP address)</li>
  <li>JOBTRACKER: the node that runs the jobtracker (IP address)</li>
  <li>NAMENODE: the HDFS name node (actual host name)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have received this information separately.  I'm not
publishing this information on the public web as a security
measure.</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">
<h2>1. Download and unpack Hadoop</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>If you're using Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>, go through this
guide to <a href="start-standalone.html">getting started in standalone
mode</a> to make sure you're comfortable with the basics.</p>

<p>The cluster is currently running a Cloudera distribution of Hadoop
0.20.1; the actual tarball are
available <a href="http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh/testing/">here</a>.
The exact release (i.e., patch level) isn't too important, and even if
I list it here, it'll probably get out of date quickly (if it is
important to find out exactly what's running on the server, the
jobtracker will tell you).  For the most part, a slight mistmatch in
the release on the client and server won't cause any problems, so you
could just pick the latest release.  You can even use
the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">stock Hadoop
distribution</a>.</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">
<h2>2. Site up configuration files</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>We have to configure Hadoop.  Configuration parameters are stored
in the conf directory under your base distribution path, in three
separate files: core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, mapred-site.xml.</p>

<p>The following configuration information goes
in <b>core-site.xml</b>:</p>

<pre>
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.default.name&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;NAMENODE&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hadoop.job.ugi&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;UGI&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hadoop.rpc.socket.factory.class.default&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.net.SocksSocketFactory&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hadoop.socks.server&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;localhost:6789&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hadoop.tmp.dir&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;/tmp/hadoop&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>

<p>For NAMENODE, substitute the fully-qualified hostname of the
namenode.  This should begin with "<code>hdfs://</code>" and end with a port
number.  The UGI property specifies file permissions you have in HDFS
and will vary by user.  Ask me what this should be, or otherwise just
put in your username twice separated by a comma.  So if your username
is "foo", put "foo,foo" here.</p>

<p>The following configuration information goes
in <b>hdfs-site.xml</b>:</p>


<pre>
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.default.name&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;NAMENODE&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>

<p>Finally, the following configuration information goes
in <b>mapred-site.xml</b>:</p>

<pre>
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;mapred.job.tracker&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;JOBTRACKER:8021&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here, substitute JOBTRACKER for its actual IP address.  Port 8021
is a commonly-used port for the jobtracker.</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">
<h2>3. Open up a SOCKS proxy</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>On your local machine, open up a shell and invoke the following
command:</p>

<pre>
ssh -D 6789 username@GATEWAY
</pre>

<p>Make sure you substitute your real username and the actual IP
address for GATEWAY.  Enter your password and log in when prompted.
After you've logged in, minimize this window, as you won't need it
anymore.  The only purpose of connecting to the gateway is to let you
tunnel directly to the cluster.</p>

<p>Here, I'm assuming that you have ssh installed.  In Windows, your
best bet is to install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>; ssh
isn't installed by default, so you'll have to manually specify the
package.</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">
<h2>4. Test drive the cluster</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>With the above steps and bit of luck, you should be able to access
the Hadoop cluster.  Try things out with a simple command from a new
shell on your local machine (i.e., <b>not</b> from the ssh shell
connected to the gateway above):</p>

<pre>
hadoop fs -ls /
</pre>

<!-- p>Also, try submitting a job by running the pi demo:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar hadoop-0.20.1-examples.jar pi 10 100
</pre>

-->

<p>You should be able to see the contents of HDFS.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Hadoop only works with SOCKS v5, so if you have an
older version of ssh that only supports SOCKS v4, then you should
upgrade (or get your admin to).  This is a known problem with some
CLIP machines.  This issue manifests in really unhelpful error
messages.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Windows users under Cygwin might get the following
error:</p>

<pre>
javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Login failed: Expect one token as the result of whoami: Jimmy Lin
</pre>

<p>The reason for this is that Cygwin uses your Windows username when
trying to connect to the cluster, which may have a space in it, e.g.,
"Jimmy Lin" (which causes the above login error).  To fix this, edit
/etc/password, which in actuality would be <code>c:\cygwin\etc\password</code> if
your Cygwin install path was <code>c:\cygwin\</code>.  Find the entry for your
username and remove the space (first field); following standard
conventions I also like to downcase my entire username, e.g.,
"jimmylin".  While you're at it you might want to rename your home
directory also (second to last field).</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">
<h2>5. Connect to the webapps</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>To access the jobtracker Webapp, you'll have to get your browser to
use the SOCKS proxy.  The preferred solution is FoxyProxy for Firefox.
First, download and install
FoxyProxy <a href="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/">from this link</a>.
Then, take the following steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Select menu item "Tools" &gt; "FoxyProxy" &gt; "Options".</li>

<li>Click "Add New Proxy".</li>

<li>In "General" tab, make sure the proxy is enabled.  Give it a name,
e.g., "Google/IBM cluster"</li>

<li>In "Proxy Details" tab, select "Manual Proxy Configuration", enter
"127.0.0.1" for "Host Name", 6789 for "Port", check "SOCKS Proxy?",
and make sure "SOCKS v5" is selected.</li>

<li>In "Patterns" tab, click "Add New Pattern".  Given it a name
(e.g., "default"), and enter the pattern "http://JOBTRACKER:*/*".
Substitute the real IP address.</li>

<li>You might want to add a similar pattern for accessing the HDFS
Webapp on "http://NAMENODE:*/*", or generalize the two into a single
pattern.  Say the IP address is aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, you might want to
enter a pattern like "http://aaa.bbb.*.*:*/*".  Also, to access the
task logs, you'll need to add a pattern along the lines of
"http://vm*:*/*".</li>

<li>Click "OK" to finish setting up the proxy.</li>

<li>Back in FoxyProxy Options, change "Mode" to "Use proxies based on
their pre-defined patterns and priorities".  Click "Close" to finish
up.</li>

</ol>

<p>If you navigate to <code>http://JOBTRACKER:50030/</code> in your
browser, you should be able to access the jobtracker!</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">
<h2>6. Accessing Task Logs</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>You'll want to access the task logs on the individual cluster
workers for debugging, but the problem is that the Webapp gives you
URLs that contain references to Xen virtual machines, something like
<code>http://vm-XX-XXX-X-XXX:50060/tasklog</code>... Although there's a
straightforward translation from hostname to IP address, you'd like
the process to be taken care for you automatically.  The easiest
solution is to hack your hosts file.</p>

<p>Email me or the admins for the Xen host to IP mappings (I'm not
posting publicly for obvious security reasons).  Add them to your
hosts file, the location of which varies by operating system: usually
<code>%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\</code> for Windows
NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7, and /etc/ for Linux and other Unix-like
operating systems.  For more information, consult this
helpful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file">Wikipedia
article</a>.</p>

<p>And that's it!  You should now be able to access the task logs.  If
you still can't, go back to Step 6 in the previous section: one common
problem is that your FoxyProxy pattern doesn't capture the URL and
direct connections through the proxy.</p>

<p>There is, however, one minor issue with hacking the hosts
file... which is that you'll need root privileges.  If for whatever
reason you don't have root access, there is another solution: a
Firefox plugin
called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6510">FoxReplace</a>
nicely solves the problem.  It automatically replaces text in URLs, so
we just need to give it a Xen host to IP mapping.  Go ahead and
download the plugin.  Email me for the mappings XML file.</p>

<p>Once you have FoxReplace installed, go through the following steps:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Select menu item "Tools" &gt; "FoxReplace" &gt; "FoxReplace options...".</li>

  <li>Click "Import" and load the XML mappings file you get from me.</li>

  <li>Make sure "Auto-replace on page load" is checked.</li>

  <li>Click "OK" to finish.</li>

</ol>

<p>And that should do it!</p>
