<h2>Random access to ClueWeb09 WARC records</h2>

<div class="post">
<div class="content">

<p>This page discusses the problem of random access to ClueWeb09 WARC
records, i.e., how to fetch individual web pages from the collection
quickly.  See my <a href="clue.html">guide on working with the
ClueWeb09 collection</a> for a general introduction.  The collection
is distributed as a number of gzipped WARC files, each containing
approximately 40k pages (about a TB uncompressed).  The well-known
problem with gzip files is that the format lacks an efficient way of
seeking to some point in the middle of a compressed stream&mdash;you
have to read through the entire archive each time.  Therefore, if the
web page being retrieved resides at the end of the gzipped WARC file,
you'll have to basically read through the entire file.</p>

<p>For information retrieval experiments, there are several
workarounds. Often, the documents of interest are known in advance, in
which case, a not unreasonable solution is to perform a sequential
scan through the entire collection and pull out documents of interest.
Obviously, this isn't going to work for interactive retrieval.</p>

<p>Another solution is to simply uncompress the collection, which
works well if you have lots of disk space&mdash;in fact, that's how
we've previously worked with the collection.  However, this seems like
an awful waste of space, especially since the WARC files achieve about
a five to one compression ratio.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="post">
<h2>Compression Schemes</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>The solution is fairly obvious: let's repack the gzipped WARC files
in a block-compressed format.  The tradeoff is between space and
latency: with smaller block sizes, we achieve lower latencies, at the
cost of more space (lower compression ratio).  In the limit, we arrive
at record-level compression, where each web page is separately
compressed&mdash;the lowest possible latency (essentially, just a
seek), but space-inefficient.</p>

<p>As it turns out, SequenceFiles in Hadoop already support block- and
record-level compression.  We simply need to run some experiments to
empirically determine what the tradeoffs are.  The following
experiments specifically focus on the first WARC file in the first
English segment of ClueWeb09
(i.e., <code>ClueWeb09_English_1/en0000/00.war.gz</code>).  The
SequenceFile contains IntWritable keys and ClueWarcRecord values.
Here is the disk usage based on different compression schemes:</p>

<table>

<tr><td class="myheader"><b>compression scheme</b></td>
    <td class="myheader"><b>bytes</b></td>
    <td class="myheader"><b>difference</b></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">original gzipped WARC file</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">168967171</td>
    <td class="mycell"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">uncompressed SequenceFile</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">1047281773</td>
    <td class="mycell">+520%</td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">record-compressed SequenceFile</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">244575860</td>
    <td class="mycell">+44.7%</td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">block-compressed SequenceFile (block=1000000)</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">171185069</td>
    <td class="mycell">+1.3%</td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">block-compressed SequenceFile (block=500000)</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">172885152</td>
    <td class="mycell">+2.3%</td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">block-compressed SequenceFile (block=100000)</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">185094067</td>
    <td class="mycell">+9.5%</td></tr>

</table>

<p>We see that web pages compress very well; here, slightly better
than five to one.  As expected, record-level compression isn't very
space-efficient.  It took a while to figure out, but the compression
block size is controlled by the obscure Hadoop parameter
"io.seqfile.compress.blocksize" (measured in bytes), with a default of
1000000.  The default value seems to work well&mdash;barely a loss in
compression efficiency (and this includes SequenceFile space
overhead).</p>

<p>What about latency?  These experiments were done on a local
machine, so latency measurements aren't going to be particularly
meaningful, since in the end we're going to be fetching from
SequenceFiles stored in HDFS (actual end-to-end latency results will
be presented later).  For now, computing the block size (in number of
records) will at least give us a sense of how much sequential reading
can be expected under different conditions.  This particular WARC file
contains 35582 web pages.  Results are shown below:</p>

<table>

<tr><td class="myheader"><b>compression scheme</b></td>
    <td class="myheader"><b># blocks</b></td>
    <td class="myheader"><b>avg. pages/block</b></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">block-compressed SequenceFile (block=1000000)</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">1024</td>
    <td class="mycell">35</td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">block-compressed SequenceFile (block=500000)</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">2004</td>
    <td class="mycell">18</td></tr>

<tr><td class="mycell">block-compressed SequenceFile (block=100000)</td>
    <td class="mycell" align="right">8673</td>
    <td class="mycell">4</td></tr>

</table>

<p>These experiments were performed with
ScanBlockCompressedSequenceFile in edu.umd.cloud9.collection.clue,
which scans a block-compressed SequenceFile and outputs the block
boundaries.</p>

<p>Note that the Hadoop SequenceFile block-compression scheme is
parameterized by block size (which is the correct design decision),
not number of records, so number of pages per block will depend on
sizes of individual pages.  These results show that, with the default
block size, accessing a random page will on average require
sequentially reading through 17 other pages.  There is an additional
tradeoff to consider: for random access, it is necessary to hold all
block pointers (offsets) in memory.  The smaller the block size, the
more the blocks, and hence the larger memory footprint of structures
necessary to support random access.  All things considered, the
default block size appears to be a good choice.</p>

<div class="post">
<h2>Repacking the WARC Files</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> comes with a program for repacking
the original ClueWeb09 gzipped WARC files into block-compressed
SequenceFiles.  Sample invocation:</p>

<pre>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.collection.clue.RepackClueWarcRecords \
/shared/ClueWeb09/collection.raw /shared/ClueWeb09/collection.compressed.block/en.01 1 \
/shared/ClueWeb09/docno-mapping.dat block
</pre>

<p>The first argument is the path of the collection, the second is the
output directory, the third is the segment number, the fourth is the
docno mapping data file (which is required since the keys in the
SequenceFiles contain docnos), and the final argument is the string
"block" (for block-level compression), "record" (for record-level
compression), and "none" (for no compression).  Since we have the
luxury of a large cluster (a few hundred machines), repacking the
first English segment of ClueWeb09 takes about twenty minutes (with
Java built-in compression; with native libraries this should be even
faster).</p>

<p>A sample result: the first English segment of ClueWeb09 weighs in
at 247,363,677,391 bytes in its original distribution.  After
repacking, the size expands ever so slightly to 250,062,048,064 byte.
For a tiny cost in space, we get random access...</p>

</div></div>

<div class="post">
<h2>Supporting Random Access</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>A forward index that will support random access to ClueWeb09 web
pages is as simple as noting where all the block boundaries are.
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> has a indexer to do exactly that.
Sample invocation:</p>

<pre>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.collection.clue.BuildClueWarcForwardIndex \
/shared/ClueWeb09/collection.compressed.block/en.01 /tmp/findex/ \
/shared/ClueWeb09/collection.compressed.block/findex.en.01.dat
</pre>

<p>The first argument is the location of the repacked block-compressed
SequenceFiles, the second is a temporary path for MapReduce output,
and the third is the location of the index file to be written.</p>

<p>The index file contains all the block locations in a binary-encoded
format.  Each block location is a triple of docno, block byte offset,
and file number.  To support random access, all block locations are
loaded into memory in an array.  Given the docno of a page, fetching
it involves performing binary search over the block locations to find
the correct block, opening up the proper file, seeking to the block
byte offset, and reading through records until the desired docno is
encountered.  This is handled by the class ClueWarcForwardIndex in
edu.umd.cloud9.collection.clue, which implements exactly the algorithm
sketched above and provides an abstraction for fetching ClueWeb09 web
pages.</p>

<p>Finally, some empirical results: on our cluster running Hadoop
0.20.1, with block-compressed SequenceFiles stored in HDFS, we get
random access latencies in the 100-150ms range.  The configuration of
the cluster at the time of the experiment was 99 nodes, 198 cores, two
400 GB disks per node.  In a bandwidth saturated scenario (e.g., while
the cluster is running a distcp) latency drops to the 150-200ms range,
which is still acceptable.  Note that in these experiments we were
using built-in Java compression; once again, with native libraries
this should be substantially faster).  This appears to be acceptable
for interactive retrieval, especially considering that end-to-end
latency is dominated by other things like fetching page images
remotely.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="post">
<h2>Random Access Webapp</h2>
<div class="content">

<p>Finally, as a "cute" hack, we've developed a webapp for accessing
ClueWeb09 pages within Hadoop itself.  The lightweight HTTP
server <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> is already
included in the Hadoop distribution (it's what runs the jobtracker,
namenode, and other webapps).  What we've done is folded a Jetty
server into a mapper, so you can fire up the webapp in the same way
you start a Hadoop job.  In this case, the Hadoop job has only one
mapper, and the mapper starts up a Jetty server.  The webapp support
fetching pages by both docno and docid.  Here's a sample
invocation:</p>

<pre>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.collection.DocumentForwardIndexHttpServer \
/shared/ClueWeb09/collection.compressed.block/findex.en.01.dat \
/shared/ClueWeb09/docno-mapping.dat
</pre>

<p>The first argument is the location of the forward index file, and
the second argument is the location of the docno mapping file.  This
webapp has been tested on Hadoop 0.20.1 and there are known issues with
earlier Hadoop versions (since they used a different version of Jetty
with an incompatible API).</p>

<p>When the server starts up, it'll report back the host information
of the node it's running on (along with the port).  You can then
direct your browser at the relevant URL.  The webapp looks something
like this:</p>

<img style="margin-bottom: 10px" src="clue-webapp-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of interface for accessing documents in ClueWeb09" />

<p>And that's it!  Have fun!  Please give us feedback if you find any
issues, find any bugs, etc.</p>
